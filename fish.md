Fish.....................
I honestly don't even know what to say about fish.  I guess I don't really know very much about fish. But I do love fish.  Fishing makes me sad.  Even catch and release seems sad.  The fish is hooked, there has to be damage, kept out of the water, and then thrown back.  Seems harmful to me.
